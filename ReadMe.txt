This is a database test code I created a few years ago.

The report.py code will generate a customer report from a given .sq file. The one provided in the repository will work and is what the current report will pull from. If need be, the file the code pulls from can be different so long as it is either named the same as the original file, or the specific name is changed within the db.py code.
